# AERO70008 (Computational Fluid Dynamics) Coursework 2024-25

This repository contains the code, results, and reports for the two courseworks of AERO70008, taught and assessed by Profs. Francesco Montomoli and Sylvain Laizet at Imperial College London, Department of Aeronautics.

## Coursework 1
Two second-order accurate in time and space numerical schemes for solving the linear advection equation (Leap Frog and Angled Derivative) were implemented in MATLAB.

## Coursework 2
A Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) code in FORTRAN used to model a 2D heat exchanger based on circular cylinders was modified. Different temporal and spatial schemes were implemented, reversal of flow was introduced, and periodic boundary conditions were replaced with inlet/outlet conditions.
